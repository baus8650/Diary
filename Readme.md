# Welcome to Diary! 

This app is a very basic journal-esque app to record daily thoughts or whatever you would like to keep a record of!

Login or create a new account to start adding, editing, or deleting diary posts. Once you start recording entries, the main screen will color-code your entries based on the mood you selected when creating a new entry. Once you create an entry, you can easily edit the entry by tapping on the entry and clicking "Edit" in the top right corner.

This is my first app following the completion of the iOS Bootcamp hosted on Udemy by instructor Dr. Angela Yu and I will gladly welcome any feedback! I want to enter the field of iOS development and there is still so much left to learn!
